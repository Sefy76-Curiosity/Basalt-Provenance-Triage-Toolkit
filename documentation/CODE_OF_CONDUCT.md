* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, including but not limited to:

* GitHub repository (issues, pull requests, discussions)
* Email communications
* Social media mentions
* In-person events or meetups
* Any other forums where the project is represented

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project lead at **sefy76@gmail.com**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

### What to Include in a Report

Please include as much detail as possible:
* Your contact information
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved
* Description of the behavior
* When and where the incident occurred
* Any supporting documentation (screenshots, links, etc.)
* Any other relevant context

### Confidentiality

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases, we may need to make a public statement, but will do so only after removing all identifying information, and only if necessary to protect other community members.

### Response Timeline

* **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours of receiving a report
* **Investigation**: Within 7 days
* **Resolution**: Within 14 days (may take longer for complex cases)

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Appeal Process

If you believe an enforcement decision was made in error, you may appeal by:

1. Sending an email to **sefy76@gmail.com** with "Appeal" in the subject line
2. Including the original report reference (if available)
3. Explaining why you believe the decision was incorrect
4. Providing any additional relevant information

Appeals will be reviewed within 14 days. The decision on appeals is final.
