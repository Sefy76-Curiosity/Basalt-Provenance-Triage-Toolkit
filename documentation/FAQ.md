Display     1280x800                        1920x1080

See INSTALLATION.md for details.

Do I need to know Python?

No. This is a GUI application — you interact through menus and buttons.
However, knowing Python helps if you want to create custom plugins or modify engines.

Is ttkbootstrap required?

Yes. The entire UI uses ttkbootstrap for a modern look and consistent theming.
Install it with:
    pip install ttkbootstrap

Does it work offline?

Yes! All functionality works offline except:
    AI assistant plugins using external APIs (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.)
    Downloading additional dependencies via Plugin Manager
    Some online data sources (EarthChem, USGS)

Toolkit AI (built-in) works 100% offline — no API key needed.

How do I update to new versions?

    cd scientific-toolkit
    git pull origin main
    pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Your data, projects, and settings are preserved.
Clear the AI knowledge cache after updates: delete config/ai_knowledge_cache.json
so Toolkit AI rescans the new plugins.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Data & Files
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What file formats are supported?

Import:
    CSV (any delimiter)
    Excel (.xlsx, .xls)
    Tab-delimited text
    Hardware-specific: Bruker, Niton, Olympus, SciAps, Thermo
    Spectral: .spa, .opj, .dpt, .wdf, .ngs, .jdx
    Images: .jpg, .png, .tif (for lithics/photos)

Export:
    CSV
    Excel
    JSON
    PDF (figures)
    PNG/SVG (figures)
    KML (for Google Earth)
    Shapefile (GIS)

Can I save my work and come back later?

Yes. Projects are saved as .stproj files (JSON format). They store:
    All sample data
    Column order and structure
    Current filters and search terms
    Selected classification scheme
    Active field panel
    UI state (tabs, page numbers)
    Window size and position

Auto-save creates recovery.stproj every 5 minutes and prompts for recovery on startup
if unsaved work is detected.

How big can my datasets be?
Size                Performance
<1,000 samples      Smooth, instant
1,000-5,000 samples Good, slight delay on some operations
5,000-10,000 samples Slower but usable
>10,000 samples     Not recommended

For large datasets: use filters, enable pagination, or export to R/Python.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Classifications & Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

How many classification engines are there?

70 classification engines across 1 engine type, plus 10 multi-stage protocols:
Engine Type             Count   Description
Classification Engine   70      Rule-based JSON schemes
Protocol Engine         10      Multi-stage workflows

These cover: Geochemistry (20+), Metamorphic petrology (5+), Sedimentology (12+),
Geochronology (3+), Isotope geochemistry (3+), Environmental (8+), Soil science (8+),
Archaeology (10+), Meteoritics (6+), Archaeometallurgy (5+), Hydrogeochemistry (5+),
Provenance & tectonics (5+), Alteration & weathering (3+), Analytical QA/QC (4+).

Are the methods peer-reviewed?

Yes. We implement published methods from scientific literature.
See CITATIONS.md for all 200+ references.

Can I add my own classification schemes?

Yes! Classification engines are JSON files in engines/classification/:
    Copy _TEMPLATE.json to a new file
    Add your rules using supported operators (>, <, between, etc.)
    Save and restart — your scheme appears in the dropdown

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Field Panels
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What are Field Panels?

Field Panels are domain-specific right-panel modules that replace the Classification HUD
when a recognised data type is loaded. They show live diagrams, computed summaries, and
domain-relevant derived values — all updated instantly when you select rows in the main
table.

16 domains are supported: geochemistry, geochronology, petrology, structural,
geophysics, spatial, archaeology, zooarchaeology, spectroscopy, chromatography,
electrochemistry, materials, solution chemistry, molecular biology,
meteorology, and physics.

How does auto-detection work?

When data is imported, the right panel checks column names against each domain's
detection list. If a match is found (e.g., sio2, tio2, al2o3 → geochemistry),
a prompt appears: "Switch to [Domain] Panel?" Clicking Yes loads the field panel.
The Back button always returns you to the Classification HUD.

Can I switch panels manually?

Yes. The right panel menu lets you load any of the 16 field panels regardless of
auto-detection — useful when columns are named non-standardly.

Does the geochemistry panel actually draw diagrams?

Yes. The Geochemistry Field Panel embeds live Matplotlib/TkAgg figures directly
inside the right panel, rendering a TAS diagram (Le Bas et al. 1986), AFM diagram,
and Mg# histogram. These update as you select or deselect rows.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Toolkit AI
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What is Toolkit AI? How is it different from the other AI plugins?

Toolkit AI is a built-in AI assistant (v2.2) that understands the toolkit's own
structure. It scans every plugin file at startup using static AST analysis, reads
all classification scheme JSON files, and builds an internal knowledge index.

Unlike external AI plugins (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini), Toolkit AI:
    - Requires no API key
    - Works completely offline
    - Knows every plugin, scheme, and field panel by name
    - Can recommend plugins based on your data type
    - Can trigger one-click plugin installation

Can Toolkit AI recommend plugins for my data?

Yes. Based on what data you've loaded and what analyses you've run,
Toolkit AI suggests relevant plugins. For example:
    Loading geochemistry data → suggests Thermobarometry Suite, Normative Calculator
    Loading spectral data → suggests Spectral Toolbox
    Loading zooarch data → suggests Zooarchaeology Analysis Suite

Does Toolkit AI need internet access?

No. It scans the local codebase only. Internet is only needed if you ask it to
check the online plugin store for new plugins to download.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Statistical Console
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What is the Statistical Console?

A plain-language statistics terminal for users who aren't programmers.
It runs inside the center panel as its own tab, with a dark terminal-style interface.

One-click buttons run: Summary, Describe, Correlate, Groups, T-Test.
Text commands at the prompt offer finer control.

Does it require scipy or R?

No. It uses Python's built-in statistics module only.
No additional dependencies beyond the core install.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Macro Recorder
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What actions can the macro recorder capture?

13 action types are captured:
    import_file, add_row, classify, scheme_changed, run_protocol, sort_by,
    tab_switched, generate_plot, apply_filter, delete_selected, update_row,
    prev_page, next_page

Can I replay macros on different datasets?

Yes. Macros are replayed against whatever data is currently loaded.
File paths recorded during import will be replayed literally — use macro
editing (export → edit JSON → import) to update paths.

What about manual cell edits?

Manual in-table cell edits are intercepted but not yet fully replayed.
The action type is reserved for a future release. Other edit actions
(delete_selected, update_row via DataHub) are captured and replayed.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Auto-Save
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

How does auto-save work?

Every 5 minutes (configurable), the background thread checks for unsaved changes.
If found, it writes project data to auto_save/recovery.stproj using an atomic
write-then-rename pattern — meaning the recovery file is never in a partial state.

What was the race condition that was fixed?

The previous implementation called data_hub.mark_saved() from the background thread
with no lock, while the UI thread could be modifying data simultaneously.
Two threading.Lock objects (_save_lock and _data_lock) now guard all shared state
between the UI and background threads.

Will I be prompted to recover if the application crashed?

Yes. On startup, if recovery.stproj is less than 24 hours old, a dialog asks:
"Found unsaved work from [time]. Would you like to recover it?"
Yes loads it; No deletes the file.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

What if my instrument isn't supported?

Option 1: File Monitor — watches a folder and auto-imports CSV/Excel from your instrument
Option 2: Universal Parser — handles any 2-column or tabular CSV
Option 3: Create a plugin — follow patterns in existing hardware plugins

Do I need special drivers?

Usually not. USB serial, USB HID, Bluetooth, and file monitoring all use OS-native support.
Some Windows devices may need a manufacturer's USB serial driver (FTDI, Prolific, etc.).

Linux users: add yourself to the dialout group:
    sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER    # then log out and back in

How many AI assistants are available?

8 total:
Plugin          Provider        Requires
Toolkit AI      Built-in        Nothing — offline, no API key
Claude AI       Anthropic       API key (free tier available)
ChatGPT         OpenAI          API key (free tier available)
Gemini AI       Google          API key (free tier available)
DeepSeek AI     DeepSeek        API key (free tier available)
Grok AI         xAI             API key
Copilot AI      Microsoft       API key
Ollama AI       Local           Ollama installation (free, no key, offline)

What's the difference between Toolkit AI and the other AI plugins?

Toolkit AI knows the toolkit. It scans all plugins and schemes and recommends
workflows based on what you've actually installed and loaded. It cannot answer
general scientific questions about topics outside the toolkit.

External AI plugins (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.) can answer general scientific questions
and interpret your data in broad context, but don't inherently know the toolkit's
structure unless you explain it.

Is my data sent to AI companies?

Only if you use external AI assistant plugins AND explicitly query them.
Your data stays local otherwise. Toolkit AI and Ollama never send anything externally.

Misc
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Why ttkbootstrap instead of vanilla tkinter/ttk?

ttkbootstrap provides a modern, themed widget set built on top of tkinter.
The UI uses ttkbootstrap throughout for:
    - Consistent modern theming across all panels
    - Better visual hierarchy
    - Easier widget styling (bootstyle= parameter)
    - No external dependency beyond Python

Why was this created?

To provide free, integrated tools for budget-constrained researchers.
Many labs cannot afford $5,000-8,000/year in software subscriptions.

Software                    Annual Cost
ioGAS                       ~$2,000
SPSS                        ~$1,500
ArcGIS                      ~$1,600
MATLAB                      ~$2,150
Specialized petrology tools ~$1,000-3,000
Total commercial stack       $5,000-10,000/year
Scientific Toolkit           $0

What's the long-term plan?

Timeline    Plans
2026 Q2     Video tutorials, more classification engines
2026 Q3     Performance optimization for large datasets
2026 Q4     Peer-reviewed methods publication
2027        Community plugin repository, possible web interface

Will this always be free?

Yes. Free to use forever. Just don't try to sell it or profit from the code itself.
